# MedicalImageSegmentation
Take home exam done for a medical imaging company. Images were originally provided as 3D DICOM files, and as I have a 2GB MX150, these had to be converted into 2D slides for segementation

Question 1 was regular segmentation, which was performed with a modified UNet. Results for Dice and Jaccard score were 0.97 and 0.94 on the validation set, respectively.
